      <h2>First devblog! Devblog #1</h2>
      <p id="blog-date"><i>07/17/2022</i></p>

      <p>Hi everyone, this is the first lothus devblog,
        I want to show what I did so far. Since just me (<a href="https://github.com/lkzof"  target=”_blank”>@lucazof</a>) are making the game, I doesn't
        have much to show yet, but..
      </p>

       <h3>One month of development:</h3>
       <p>Well, one month has passed since I started developing Lothus, and to be honest, it all started as a meme. But after some days
        I started really liking the project, and now the game have a lot of different things, and I pretend expanding it even more. One
        thing that's sad is the fact I'm doing all by my own. I have no help and everything is slow to finish, on the next weeks problably
        this problem will be over, because I'm going to search some other people to help developing the game. If <strong>you</strong> want to be part
        of the project, <a href="../../apply/index.html">click here for more info.</a>

        <h3>The first days:</h3>
        <p>
          As I said before, it all started as a Meme. I was watching some youtube videos about game development, and in my mind an old idea
          has resurfaced like a phoenix. When I was a kid my favorite game genre was Survival, I played a lot of survival games. Around 2015 I 
          started making some games for fun, and making a survival game always was my goal. Unfortunately, <a>@lucazof</a> kid didn't 
          achieve success. But, 7 years later and here I am. Let's see if I will be better succesful than my 10 year old version was.<br><br>

          But alright, lets stop talking about me, and focus on the game:

        <p>This print was taken on the first day of development. As you can see, It's very clear that I was just doing it for fun. On the next days
          I started adding more features, like procedural world generation. It was pretty bad (and still is), I could now generate random worlds, thats
          awesome! It was just a plane with some colors, but some progress has been done.<br><br>

          Some other things I added was Multiplayer Network. I used Photon for this, and it worked pretty well (after fixing some issues here and there). I stop
          developing the game after this, and some weeks later I came back. This time trees and rocks were been added randomly across the map. A main menu
          was created as well, with the possibility to create or join a multiplayer lobby.
        </p>

        <h3>Current State of Development:</h3>
        <p>Now I'm working on the Inventory System, and upgrading the game visuals improving the lighting system. There's a lot to do, and alone this might
          take forever, but I'm going till the end! These devblogs will be posted every sunday at 12 PM (I will do my best to be consistent in my posts)</p><br>
